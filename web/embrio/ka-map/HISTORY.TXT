Version 0.2.0 (2006-02-07)
--------------------------
Its been waaay to long since the last release and the changes are very numerous.  I'm just going to cover some highlights that I remember right now ... After this version, every change is going to go through bugzilla and be referenced in here.

- sample interface rewrite to table-less css layout (thanks Lorenzo and Andrea!)

- improvements to legend and keymap code (thanks Lorenzo and Andrea!)

- included javascript scalebar maintained by Tim Schaub (thanks Tim!)

- added clickable/draggable keymap (thanks Lorenzo!)

- added support for mouse scroll zooming (thanks Ed!)

- added kaQuery.js for generic query support (i.e. ROI selection)

- restructured directory structure for better security and ease of installation
  which necessitated a change in config.php - everyone needs to update.

- added variable image format code (thanks Jacob!)

- added object placement API

- added tool API and removed navigation stuff to a new tool (kaTool.js)

- Bug 1049: Fixed problem with JPEG output format (szCacheFile was 
  hardcoded to .png extension in tile.php)

- removed need for initMap.php, the logic for initializing a map has been
  into the javascript function kaMap_selectMap.
  
- added default extents and max extents to initialization (although max extents
  are not yet used).

- switched to a larger default tile size (300x300 instead of 200x200) because
  it seems to improve performance
  
- completely rewrote kaLegend to be entirely client side

Version 0.1.0 (2005-05-18)
--------------------------

- First public release.
