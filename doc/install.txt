                                     Bugs

   Known bugs and limitations to UL>

     Process Inputs definition is made on very primitive way. But it
   works.

     Sometimes, when there is e.g. SyntaxError in the process, teporary
   file /tmp/pywps* is not deleted, which ledts to ServerBussy exception
   and the files have to be removed by hand.

     If inputs are of type LiteralValue and it's type is string, it is
   not controlled properly. Take care on your inputs and do not use it
   directly in scripts to avoid your server to be hacked.

   Please report all problems or unexpected handeling.

                                 Installation

   Required packages:

     * Web Server (e.g. Apache)
     * python
     * python-xml

   Recommended packages:

     * GIS GRASS
     * PROJ.4
     * GDAL/OGR

Installation the quick 'n' dirty way

   For installing pywps to your server simply unzip the archive to the
   directory, where cgi programs are allowed to run.

Installation the 'clean' way

   Unzip the package
 $ tar -xzf pywps-VERSION.tar.gz

   and run
$ python setup.py install

Testing after installation

   For test, just run wps.py in your command line:

\$ ./wps.py
Content-type: text/xml

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<ExceptionReport version="1.0.0" xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/ows"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <Exception exceptionCode="MissingParameterValue" locator="request"/>
</ExceptionReport>

   If you got some other message, like e.g.:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "trunk/index.py", line 53, in ?
    from Wps import wpsexceptions
  File "/home/jachym/prog/pywps/trunk/Wps/wpsexceptions.py", line 8, in ?
    from xml.dom.minidom import Document
ImportError: No module named xml.dom.minidom

   Than something is wrong with your Python installation or with the
   program. This message means, that the xml.dom.minidom package is not
   installed in your system.

                                 Configuration

   Before you start to tune your pywps program, you should get your copy
   of OpenGIS(R) Web Processing Service document (OGC 05-007r4) version
   0.4.0 from http://www.opengeospatial.org/specs/?page=specs

   NOTE: Note, that the configuration option are CASE SENSITIVE

   Pywps configuration takes places in two files. The files are actually
   python scripts, so it does not harm, if you have some experience in
   python programming language. But you should be able to setup the
   program without any python knowledge.

   The first file is in etcsettings.py and (optional) the second file is
   etcgrass.py which has to be setuped if you do want to use GRASS GIS
   modules in your scripts. Some special "tuning" can be done in
   processes/__init__.py file

etc/settings.py

   This file has got two sections: WPS and serverSettings

   In the WPS section, the main configuration is set, which appears
   mostly in GetCapabilities request. The mandatory parameters, which
   should be set up are (with default/recommend values):

    'version': "0.4.0",
    'ServiceIdentification': {
        'Title':"Jachym's WPS server",
        'ServiceType':"WPS",
        'ServiceTypeVersion':"0.1.0",
        'Abstract':'Abstract to this WPS',
    },
    'ServiceProvider': {
            'ProviderName' : "Your Company",
            'IndividualName':"Your Name",
            'PositionName':"Your Position",
            'Role':"your role",
            'DeliveryPoint': "Street",
            'City': "City",
            'PostalCode':"00000",
            'Country': "Your country",
            'ElectronicMailAddress':"your.email@address",
    },

    'OperationsMetadata': {
        'ServerAddress' : "http://localhost/cgi-bin/wps/wps.py",
    },
    'Keywords' : ['GRASS','GIS','WPS'],

   In the ServerSettings section, the variables are set, which have
   impact on the whole server.

# NOTE: You have to create this directory manually and set rights, so
#       the program is able to store data in there
'outputPath': '/var/www/wpsoutputs',

#
# 'outputUrl' - URL of the directory, where the outputs will be stored
'outputUrl':  'http://192.168.1.31/wpsoutputs',

#
# tempPath - path to directory, where temporary data will be stored.
# NOTE: the pywps has to have rights, to create directories and files
#       in this directory
'tempPath': '/tmp',

#
# maxOperations - maximum number of operations, which is allowed to low
# on this server at ones
# default = 1
'maxOperations':1,

#
# maxSize: maximum input file size in bytes
# NOTE: maximum file size is 5MB, no care, if this number is higher
'maxSize':5242880, # 5 MB

#
# maxInputParamLength: maximal length of input values
# NOTE: maximum length of input parameters is 256, no matter, how height
#       is this number
'maxInputParamLength':256,

etc/grass.py

   This file servers for configuration of GRASS GIS environment (if your
   processes need one). Everything is stored in grassenv structure.

# PATH in which your modules (processes) should be able the search.
# Default value:
'PATH': "/usr/local/grass-6.1.cvs/bin/:/usr/local/grass-6.1.cvs/scripts/:\
/usr/bin/:/bin/:",

# Add eventually some other path, in which should GRASS search for modules
'GRASS_ADDON_PATH': "",

# Version of GRASS, you are using
'GRASS_VERSION': "6.1.cvs",

# GRASS_PERL, where is your PERL bin installed
'GRASS_PERL': "/usr/bin/perl",

# GRASS_GUI should be always "text" unless you know, what you are doing
'GRASS_GUI': "text",

# GISBASE is place, where your GRASS installation is
'GISBASE': "/usr/local/grass-6.1.cvs",

# LD_LIBRARY_PATH
'LD_LIBRARY_PATH':"/usr/local/grass-6.1.cvs/lib",

# HOME has to be set
'HOME':"/var/www",

                            Add your own processes

   All processes are stored in the processes directory. Put your file
   e.g. myprocess.py in there.

   Process is python class with two functions: __init__(self) and
   execute(self). In the __init__(self) function, inputs, outputs and
   other configuration values are set. The GIS operations are called in
   execute(self) function. It is possible also to add as many your
   functions, as you wish.

Process Configuration

   The configuration part belongs to the __init__ function of the Process
   class.

   Mandatory variables are

# Myprocess name
self.Identifier = "spearpath"

# Myprocess version
self.processVersion = "0.1"

# Is it allowed, store the data on the server?
self.storeSupported = "true"

# Do not wait, till the calculation is done -> return XML with status
# immediately
self.statusSupported = "true"

# Myprocess Title
self.Title="Find the shortest path on the roads map on Spearfish dataset"

   Eventually optional attributes can be found in the table 38 - "Parts
   of ExecuteResponse data structure"

   If your process should happen in existing GRASS-Location, and you just
   need the input parameters for GRASS modules, you can specify it's name
   by grassLocation variable:

grassLocation="/var/grassdata/spearfish57/"

   If this variable is set to None, new temporary GRASS Location &&
   mapset will be generated and you can work in there. The projection of
   the location will be XY. If this variable is not set, GRASS will not
   be stared.

    Metadata defition

   is stored in array self.Metadata in __init__ function:
# Metadata definition
self.Metadata = [
    {   "Identifier":"point",
        "type":"point",
        "textContent":"Click in the map"
        },
    ]

   This code will produce in DescribeProcess responce document following
   element:
...
<ows:Metadata Identifier="point" type="point">
    Click in the map
</ows:Metadata>
...

  Data Inputs

   Data inputs are defined in self.Inputs array. Each input is an
   dictionary with several (mostly mandatory) parameters. Each input type
   (LiteralValue, ComplexValue, ComplexValueReference, BoundingBoxValue)
   must be a Python's dictionary ("{}") structure, which can be filled
   with aditional attributes.

     * Example of LiteralInput: LiteralValues are used for individual
       text entry. Your process can either support any text entry or the
       entry must be from list of allowed values. LiteralValues of types
       AnyValue and AllowedValues are supported. Range of values is not
       yet implemented.
       Allowed values are set by array of values. If there is no values
       arry or it contains "*" in the array, AnyValue is assumed:
       Array of defined values can be defined too:
    {   # example of "AnyValue" case with centimeters as default unit

        'Identifier': 'my_input_value',
        'Title': 'This is my input value',
        'LiteralValue': {'UOMs':["cm"]},
        # alternative for any value:
        # 'LiteralValue': {'values':["*"]},
        'dataType': type(0.0)
    },
    {   # example of "AllowedValues" case with default units (meters)

        'Identifier': 'my_input_value',
        'Title': 'This is my input value',
        'LiteralValue': {values:[250, "300", '40', "a"]},
        # the default value:
        'value': 250,
    },

    {   # example of "Range" case with default units (meters)
        # allowed values are only <250;300> and <350;400>

        'Identifier': 'my_input_value',
        'Title': 'This is my input value',
        'LiteralValue': {values:[[250,300],[350,400]]},
        # the default value:
        'value': 250,
    },
     * Example of ComplexValueReference input:
       ComplexValueReference is URL to some raster/vector/text file,
       which can be later imported (e.g. to GRASS) and processed. PyWPS
       will be dowload the file for you and store it's name to
       self.DataInputs["<Identifier>"] variable.

    NOTE:

   ComplexValueReference input is depredecated and should not be used.
   Use ComplexValue structure instead. PyWPS will recognise if the input
   is of type ComplexValue or ComplexValueReference and handle the input
   accordingly.

   Example of ComplexValue input: ComplexValue provides possibility to
   embed input (XML) file (e.g. GML) to input ExecuteResponce XML file.
   PyWPS will store this input in file on server's harddisk, so you can
   later handle it just like ComplexValueReference.

    {
        'Identifier':'vector',
        'Title': 'Input vector map',
        'Abstract':
            "This vector map must be part of the input XML document",
        'ComplexValue': {
            'Formats': [ "text/xml" ]
        },
    },

   For Formats attribute use MIME/TYPE encoding, like text/xml,
   image/tiff and similar.

   Example of BoundingBoxValue input: BoundingBoxValue provides
   possibility define your region borders. You can input this only to
   your Execute responce XML file.

    {
        'Identifier':'bbox',
        'Title': 'Bounding box',
        'Abstract':
            "Bounding box",
        'BoundingBoxValue': {},
    },

   Resulting value in your self.Input[NUMBER]['value'] will be array of
   four values in form [Lower East, Lower North, Upper East, Upper
   North].

   Default values can be set like follows: 'value':"Default value",

   NOTE: If the 'dataType' attribute is not set, control of the input
   value will not be possible, which could endanger your system

   For more details look in the table 33 "Parts of ValueFormChoice data
   structure"

  Data Outputs

   The self.Outputs structure defines the look of the outputs from your
   process. The definition is not much different from the Input
   structure:

    {
        'Identifier': 'output',
        'Title': 'Resulting output map',
        'ComplexValue': {
            'Formats':["text/xml"],
            }
    },
    {
        'Identifier': 'text',
        'Title': 'Some text',
        'Abstract': 'Some informative text',
        'LiteralValue': {
             {'UOMs':["none"]},
        }
    }

    BoundingBox Output

   BoundingBoxValue is defined by two coordinates pairs: LowerCorner and
   UpperCorner. For creating BoundingBoxValue output, you have to make
   output array with this values:
    {
        'Identifier': 'mybbox',
        'Title': 'Bounding Box of resulting map',
        'BoundingBoxValue': {},
         'value' : [0, 0, 10, 10],
    },

Process Programming

   The process must be defined in the execute(self) function. To each
   element in self.Inputs array, 'value' option will be added. Input
   variables are accessible via 'value' attribute of each element of the
   self.Inputs array.

   Another way, how to access input values it to do so via new hash
   self.DataInputs. This way is more intiutive and less confusing. If
   order of Inputs will change, their identificators in DataInputs
   structure remain same.

   Also new variable self.grassenv will be in your process at your
   service.

   Output values can be stored either directly to
   self.Outputs[index]['value'] variable or to
   self.DataOutputs['identifier'] hash on similar way, how DataInputs are
   used. This makes the usage again more intuitive.

    def execute(self):
        if os.system("""g.region -d >&2"""):
            return "Could not set region to default"

        os.system("r.in.gdal -o in=%s out=my_map >&2" %\
                                    (self.Inputs[0]['value']))
        os.system("r.mapcalc my_output=my_map+%d >&2" %\
                                    (self.DataInputs['value']))

        if os.system("r.out.gdal type=Float32 out=map.tif in=my_output >&2"):
            return "Could not export resulting raster map [map.tif]"

        self.Outputs[0]['value'] = "map.tif"
        self.DataOutputs['location'] = self.grassenv['LOCATION_NAME']
        return

   That is all, folks!

  Error handling

   At the end of the execute function, None value should be returned. Any
   other value means, that the calculation will be stopped and error
   report will be returned back to the client.

                           Note to grass programming

   The simplest way, how to call GRASS's (and other shell) commands is
   via python's os.system() or os.popen() function. Before you do so, it
   is important to import the os python package (usually one of the first
   lines in the file). This approach might not be the best, but it is the
   simplest one. Feel free to use any other low-end functions.

   Unfortunately, the GRASS modules are very verbose. Some messages are
   written to STDOUT, some to STDERR. The STDERR will be stored in the
   error file of your web server. But you have to "catch" the messages,
   sent to STDOUT. This can be done e.g. by using "1>&2" statement
   (redirecting STDOUT to STDERR in shell):

    os.system("""
        echo "Rekni jim drazi, tatko, za to nic nedas."  >&2
    """)

                           Testing your new process

     * GetCapabilities request:
    wget -nv -q -O - --post-data="version=0.4.0&service=Wps&\
        request=getcapabilities" "http://localhost/cgi-bin/wps.py"
     * DescribeProcess request:
    wget -nv -q -O - --post-data="version=0.4.0&service=Wps&\
        request=DescribeProcess&Identifier=your_process" \
        "http://localhost/cgi-bin/wps.py"
     * Execute request:
    wget -nv -q -O - --post-data="version=0.4.0&service=Wps&\
        request=Execute&Identifier=your_process&\
        datainputs=input1,value1,input2,value2" \
        "http://localhost/cgi-bin/wps.py"

                                Using the PyWPS

Input

   To get response from PyWPS you have to formulate appropriate query
   string first. You can use HTTP GET style or HTTP POST style.

   HTTP GET style is standard URL, with all parameters in one line. You
   can not set any ComplexValue data in your process via HTTP GET.
   Example:

    wget -nv -q -O - --post-data="version=0.4.0&service=Wps&\
            request=Execute&Identifier=your_process&\
            datainputs=input1,value1,input2,value2"\
            "http://localhost/cgi-bin/wps.py"

   In HTTP POST style, you send one "request" parameter, which contains
   XML input. The XML file can contain also included ComplexValue data,
   e.g. GML file. Example:

    wget --post-file=execute-post.txt \
            "http://localhost/pywps/wps.py" -O - -nv -q

   The execute-post.txt file can look like follows:
request=<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

            <ows:LiteralValue>4915876.31</ows:LiteralValue>
        </Input>
    </DataInputs>
</Execute>

   You can see, that there are 4 inputs in this process:

    1. ComplexValue GML File
    2. x1 coordinate
    3. y1 coordinate
    4. x2 coordinate
    5. y2 coordinate

Output

   The output from PyWPS can be either XML file or results of processes
   directly. In default configuration, no files are stored on the server,
   resulting values (maps) are returned to the client. If you want to
   return XML file with outputs encoding, you have to enable it in you
   process configuration with option storeSupported:

    self.storeSupported = "true"

   And you have to call the PyWPS with "store=true" option:

    version=0.4.0&service=Wps&request=Execute&Identifier=your_process&\
                    datainputs=input1,value1,input2,value2&store=true

   Or in XML input:

request=<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Execute service="WPS" version="0.4.0" store="true" status="false"
xmlns="http://www.opengeospatial.net/wps"
xmlns:ows="http://www.opengeospatial.net/ows"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengeospatial.net/wps/wpsDescribeProcess.xsd">

...

   This will cause PyWPS to look after self.status array in your process
   in form form
    self.status = ["Message", Percent_Done]

   and generate XML file in statusLocation with this embed message. E.g.
    self.status = ["Generating raster map", 50]

   will become

    ...
     <Status>
                <ProcessStarted message="Generating raster map" percentComplete
d="50"/>
    </Status>
    ...

                           Sample process: addvalue

   This sample process describes how to made your own WPS processes.
   Purpose of this process is:
     * Download input raster map from some server
     * Convert it to integer values
     * Add input value to each raster cell
     * Convert raster to vector
     * Export raster to TIFF and vector to GML. Vector file will be embed
       ot output XML file.

                       The GNU General Public License

                            Version 2, June 1991

           Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

          51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
             license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  Preamble:

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
   to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
   intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
   software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
   General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
   Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
   using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
   the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
   your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
   price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
   this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
   if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
   in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
   These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
   you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
   gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
   you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
   source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
   rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
   (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
   distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
   that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
   software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
   we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
   original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
   on the original authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
   patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
   program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
   program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
   patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
   all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.

                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
       notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
       under the terms of this General Public License. The ``Program'',
       below, refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on
       the Program'' means either the Program or any derivative work
       under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
       or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
       translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
       included without limitation in the term ``modification''.) Each
       licensee is addressed as ``you''.
       Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
       not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
       of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
       Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
       the Program (independent of having been made by running the
       Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
       source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
       conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
       appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
       intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
       absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
       Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
       You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
       and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
       for a fee.
    3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
       of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
         1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any
            change.
         2. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
            in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
            or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
            to all third parties under the terms of this License.
         3. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
            an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
            a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
            provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
            program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
            view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program
            itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
            announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
            to print an announcement.)
       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
       Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
       works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
       apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
       works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
       whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
       the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
       for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
       and every part regardless of who wrote it.
       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
       contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
       intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
       derivative or collective works based on the Program.
       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
       Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
       a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
       other work under the scope of this License.
    4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
       under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
       of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
       following:
         1. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
            source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
            Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
            software interchange; or,
         2. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
            years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
            your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
            complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
            code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
            above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
            or,
         3. Accompany it with the information you received as to the
            offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
            alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
            and only if you received the program in object code or
            executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection
            b above.)
       The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
       for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
       source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
       plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
       used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
       However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
       not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
       source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
       kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
       runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
       If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
       access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
       access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
       distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
       except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
       otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
       void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
       License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
       from you under this License will not have their licenses
       terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
       signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
       or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
       are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
       Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
       based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
       License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
       distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
    7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
       Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
       original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
       subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
       further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
       granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
       by third parties to this License.
    8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
       issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
       agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
       License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
       License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
       your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
       obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
       Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
       royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
       receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
       way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
       entirely from distribution of the Program.
       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
       under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
       intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
       in other circumstances.
       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
       any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
       of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
       protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
       which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have
       made generous contributions to the wide range of software
       distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
       application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide
       if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
       system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
       to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
       the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
       License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
       excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
       in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
       License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
       this License.
   10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
       versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
       versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
       differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
       Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
       Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
       to it and ``any later version'', you have the option of following
       the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
       version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
       does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
       any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
   11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
       programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
       author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
       the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
       Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
       will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
       all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
       and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
   12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
       WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
       LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
       AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT
       WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
       NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
       FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
       QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
       PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
       SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
       WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
       MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
       LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
       INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
       INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
       DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
       OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
       OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                           Licence of this document

                       GNU Free Documentation License

                         Version 1.2, November 2002

          Copyright ©2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
             license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                  Preamble

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
   assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
   with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
   Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
   to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
   for modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

                      1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
   distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
   world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
   work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
   to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
   and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify
   or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
   law.

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
   part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
   section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
   allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
   Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
   Sections then there are none.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be
   at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, that is suitable for revising the document
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
   to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
   or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
   An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
   of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
   transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
   include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
   proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
   processors for output purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
   this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
   the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

   A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
   title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
   text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
   specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
   "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
   of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
   section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
   states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
   Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
   License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
   implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
   no effect on the meaning of this License.

                            2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.

                           3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
   printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
   Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
   copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
   Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
   the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
   as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
   full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
   You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
   changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
   the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
   copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a computer-network location from which the general network-using
   public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
   a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
   If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
   when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
   that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
   location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
   Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
   edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
   give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.

                              4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

   A.
          Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document). You may use the same title as
          a previous version if the original publisher of that version
          gives permission.
   B.
          List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
          Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
          authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it
          has fewer than five), unless they release you from this
          requirement.
   C.
          State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.
   D.
          Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   E.
          Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.
   F.
          Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
          under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
          Addendum below.
   G.
          Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.
   H.
          Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   I.
          Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.
   J.
          Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
          "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.
   K.
          For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
   L.
          Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
   M.
          Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may
          not be included in the Modified Version.
   N.
          Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.
   O.
          Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

                           5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   Entitled "Endorsements".

                        6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
   of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
   other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.

                   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
   resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
   When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
   apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
   derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
   the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
   electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
   Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
   aggregate.

                               8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
   Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
   the original English version of this License and the original versions
   of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
   the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
   or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
   "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
   its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
   title.

                               9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

                    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
